## How are Vue components structured?

Vue components are structured as reusable and modular pieces of code that encapsulate the template, styles, and behavior for a specific piece of functionality or UI element. Components in Vue are defined using a Vue instance, which has a template, script, and style sections.

```js
export default {
  mounted() {
    console.log("]It works!");
  },
};
```

```html
<template>
  <h1>My Component Title</h1>
</template>
```
